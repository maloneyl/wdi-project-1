WDI Project 1

OPTION 3: Music self-publishing site

A collective of underground DJs have gotten together to launch a service to allow budding creatives to upload songs they produced, and take feedback from other users of the site.

The collective's spokesman is most concerned that we're able to express the individual character of the musicians through the design, and that it's easy to moderate comments, since they expect lots of trolls and spammers to bombard their site.

Additional skills exercised:
- file upload
- advanced haml/scss
